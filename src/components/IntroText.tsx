      I'm always keen to learn and enjoy challenges that involve both people and
      problem solving. Outside of work, I like spending time outdoors, playing
      guitar, and keeping my garden alive. This site shows an overview of some

      Lately Iâ€™ve been building things like payment flows, API integrations, and
      interactive map features, mostly working across both the front and back

      years, which gave me experience translating between user needs and
      technical constraints.
