      I'm always keen to learn and enjoy challenges that involve both people and
      problem solving. Outside of work, I like spending time outdoors, playing
      guitar, and keeping my garden alive, or at least trying to. This site
      shows an overview of some of the projects I've worked on, mostly working
      with React, Node, MongoDB and Tailwind CSS.
