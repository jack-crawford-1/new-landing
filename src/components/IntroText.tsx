      I'm always keen to learn and enjoy challenges that involve both people and
      problem solving. Outside of work, I like spending time outdoors, playing
      guitar, and keeping my garden alive. This site shows an overview of some

      Lately I’ve been building things like payment flows, API integrations, and
      map features, mostly working across both the front and back end. Before
      tech, I spent years in account management, so I’m used to translating
      between technical constraints and user needs.
